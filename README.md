# Simple Thesis Template

Here is the latex template I used for my PhD dissertation. It comes with an elegant title page and nicely formatted frontmatter.  My finished product lives here: https://thesiscommons.org/7uqw9/

![Title Page](https://economicsfromthetopdown.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/titlepage.png)

Tweak this template as you see fit. By default, it uses the Vancouver reference style, as implemented by PLOS ONE.



### Use

1. Replace the `bib.bib` file with your own bibtex file
2. Include you chapters in the `dissertation.tex` file
3. Compile with pdflatex
