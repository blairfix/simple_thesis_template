 It is not easy  to forge your own scientific path, let alone to declare that much of what has been written in your field   needs  to be rethought.   Contrarian thinking often leads to isolation.  Thankfully, I have not been isolated during my time at York, and much of this has to do with the work of Jonathan Nitzan. Together with Shimshon Bichler, Jonathan has created a path-breaking approach to political economy that has strongly shaped my thinking.  But more than this,   Jonathan has provided many opportunities for me to share my research, and has offered extremely useful feedback.  For this I am grateful.  I would also like to thank the `capital as power' community.  The many discussions on the web forum have been intellectually invigorating.  Parts of this dissertation have benefited from discussions with Shai Gorsky and James McMahon. 

I also owe a great debt to Charlie Hall, who took the risk of letting me (an unknown PhD student) write a book in his Energy Briefs series. The experience taught me a great deal about how to think like a scientist, and how to  communicate effectively. I would also like to thank Ellie Perkins for advising me during my seven years at York, and for giving me the freedom to chart my own path. Thank-you  also to Mark Thomas and Justin Podur for the many helpful comments.  I am also grateful for  financial support  from the Social Sciences and Humanities Resource Council, the Ontario Graduate Scholarship Program, and the Lewis and Bennett Graduate Scholarship.


Lastly, thank-you to Grace and Garry Fix for the many hours of proof reading, and to Emily and Petra for the support along this journey.
